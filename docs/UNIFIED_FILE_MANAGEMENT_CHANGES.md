# Unified File Management Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive unified file management system that centralizes all TTS artifacts and outputs into a single, well-organized directory structure. This improves organization, simplifies cleanup, and makes debugging easier.

## Key Changes

### 1. New `UnifiedFileManager` Class

Created a robust file management class in `src/file_manager.py` with the following features:
- Session-based organization with unique session IDs
- Categorized subdirectories for different file types
- Consistent file naming conventions
- Automatic cleanup of session files
- Tracking of file metadata
- Disk usage monitoring
- Singleton pattern to ensure only one session exists across components

### 2. Integration with Existing Components

- Updated `TTSApplication` to use the unified file manager
- Updated `TTSService` to use the unified file manager
- Updated `web_server.py` to use the unified file manager for API endpoints
- Maintained backward compatibility with the legacy `FileManager` class

### 3. Directory Structure

Implemented a hierarchical directory structure:
```
temp/
├── session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_uuid/
│   ├── audio/          # Audio files (.wav)
│   ├── text/           # Text files (.txt)
│   ├── translation/    # Translation files
│   └── cache/          # Cache files (voices, etc.)
└── session_*/          # Other sessions...
```

### 4. File Path Generation

Added methods for consistent file path generation:
- `create_audio_file_path()`: For audio and text files
- `create_translation_file_path()`: For translation files
- `create_cache_file_path()`: For cache files
- `get_web_audio_url()`: For web-accessible URLs

### 5. Cleanup Mechanisms

Implemented two levels of cleanup:
- `cleanup_session_files()`: Cleans up files from the current session
- `cleanup_old_sessions()`: Cleans up old session directories

### 6. Documentation

- Created `FILE_MANAGEMENT.md` with detailed documentation
- Updated `README.md` to reference the new file management system
- Added comments throughout the code

### 7. Testing

Created `test_unified_file_management.py` to verify:
- File manager initialization
- Directory structure creation
- File path generation
- Metadata tracking
- Cleanup functionality
- Integration with TTS components

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: All files are logically grouped by session and type
2. **Improved Debugging**: Easy to trace files related to a specific TTS run
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: No manual cleanup required
4. **Disk Space Management**: Old files are automatically removed
5. **Web Compatibility**: Consistent URL generation for web interface
6. **Session Tracking**: Metadata about each session is maintained

## Usage

The unified file manager is now used throughout the codebase:
- In `main.py` for CLI operations
- In `tts_service.py` for the service layer
- In `web_server.py` for web endpoints
- In `tts_generator.py` for voice caching

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the unified file management system:
```bash
make test-file-management
```

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:
1. Add file compression for long-term storage
2. Implement configurable retention policies
3. Add database integration for session tracking
4. Add file encryption for sensitive data
5. Implement cloud storage integration
